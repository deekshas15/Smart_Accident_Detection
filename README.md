# Smart_Accident_Detection
Basic information from hospitals is taken,to register them to the platform through a website. 
To build a system which can be used as a very foundation
and a first step towards building a smart city, with smart
healthcare and smart transportation systems. This Accident
detection system can be installed in any car and it will detect
accidents on its own, and if an accident is detected then it
sends the location details which are stored in the cloud. By 
using a cloud database to store these details so that it can
be accessed by anyone who is authorized to read this data, i.e.
to make it a distributed system.
The server then fetches this information from the cloud
and sends it to the hospitals, based on their proximity to the
accident site. This system is not only for hospitals, if there are
individuals who are willing to help this cause, they can enable
their location on the website, and according to the coordinates
of their current location, the website will alert them of any
accidents in the nearby area.
This will help to make the process of sending an ambulance
very efficient, as the details will only be sent to hospitals
that are registered to this service and people close to the
accident site.
